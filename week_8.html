        <p><strong>Task: </strong>
          Design something and make it using CNC. Create something by molding and casting.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Skills used: </strong>3d Modelling, SRM-20, Silicone Casting</p>
        <p>This week I wanted to create a silicone version of the same detail that I used as a print test in week 5. The detail is something that would typically be carved in wood. I was curious about how the same object would turn out with 3D printing versus casting.

        <p>I first used the CNC to create a mold. The first pass was not detailed enough to clearly capture the curves and indentations of the form, but the second pass turned out well. </p>

        <p>The model was difficult to cast as there are two deep grooves in the form that created air bubbles. The mold ended up having a bubble in it but still worked for casting. </p>
