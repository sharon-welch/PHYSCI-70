          <p><strong>Task: </strong>
            3D Print something that could not be created through substractive methods</p>
            <br>
          <p><strong>Skills used: </strong>Rhino 3D Modelling, Prusa 3D Printer, Metashape scanning software</p>
            <br>
          <p> This week I was inspired by MC Escher’s spiral drawings. This is something that could not be easily made via the subtractive method because of the way the object wraps around itself. While I did not copy MC Escher’s design exactly, I chose to make a spiral that gets smaller and wraps around itself. </p>

          <p><strong>Process: </strong>
            The spiral was modeled in Rhino. The print time was 17 hours, in part because my design required a lot of support material.</p>

          </div>

          <p>I attempted to make an additional spiral that failed twice in the printer. I believe this is because it is wound tightly, leaving small spaces where I believe the printer attempted to print support material and could not.</p>

          <p><strong>Printing Test: </strong>
            As a hobby when I am not in graduate school, I enjoy wood carving of intricate details. I was curious to see to what level of detail the Prusa could print a typical pattern that would be carved. Using 3D models that I found on the internet, I printed 2 tests. They turned out fairly smooth, although the lines formed from the printing process are highly visible.</p>

          <p><strong>Scan: </strong>
            I scanned my 3D printed spiral. As a next step, it would have been interesting to reprint form the scan to see how accurate it was.</p>
