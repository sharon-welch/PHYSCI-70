        <p><strong>Skills used: </strong>Rhino 3D Modelling, Prusa 3D Printer, Metashape scanning software</p>

        <p>For the final kit I expanded the number of pieces, creating in total 6 unique circles 9 unique semicircles. This allowed for the creation of a greater variety of forms. If I were to continue working on this exercise, I would experiment with the implications of having multiple different sizes of circles. </p>
