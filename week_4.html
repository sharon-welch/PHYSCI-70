              I experimented first with creating a series of blinking LEDs through modifying the code found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1FVSpkw6q4">here</a>.

              <p>In my initial attempt to create an LED piano, which is how I describe a group of LEDs each controlled by a separate button, I expanded the button model, only having inputs for the buttons. This did not work, as I also needed inputs for each LED to be able to control them.</p>

            <div class = "row">
              <p>In my final circuit each LED has its own input into the microcontroller, allowing me to control whether the LED was on or off when not pressing the button. However, one of the LEDs did not work. The circuit and code seemed correct and also functioned on the other two LEDs. After changing all the parts in the 3rd LED - wires, bulb, resistors - I was unable to pinpoint why it wasnâ€™t working. My final code was the following.</p>
