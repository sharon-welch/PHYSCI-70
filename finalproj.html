           <h3>Proposal</h3>
          <p>
            Note: Weeks 10 and 11 (Machine Building and Computer Programming) are incorporated into the final project and do not have their own page on my site.
            <br>
            <b>Research Question</b>: How can a bike seat be more comfortable?
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Proposal</b>: My proposal for the final project is to create a bike seat that is more comfortable. Comfort here means two things: reducing pain from long periods of riding on the seat, and preventing rubbing. The comfort of the bike seat is influenced by material, form, padding, how well the seat is adjusted to the biker, as well as other factors. Initial ideas for how to achieve a better seat are as follows.
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> Creating a bike seat that can be adjusted automatically (through sensing pressure, a phone-based app, other methods) without the rider having to get off of their bike seat </li>
              <li> Rethinking the form of the seat to prevent rubbing and non-ideal body positioning </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Justification</b>: The design of the bike seat or saddle has remained essentially the same since its invention, with small design tweaks over time. Because of the bike seat design, cyclists are more prone to urethral stricture, UTIs, genital numbness, and saddle sores, all of which can lead to long term health problems.

          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>For the final project I tackled one piece of creating a bike seat that reads in rider data to be able to change form. I created 3 pressure sensors that attach to the seat in order to show the rider their pressure distribution on the saddle. </p>
          <p><strong>Materials used: </strong>
            ESP32
            Wires, heat wrap, solder
            To make pressure sensor: velostat, fabric, copper sheet, needle and thread
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Skills used: </strong>Coding - arduino, processing
            Hand fabrication - pressure sensors
            Soldering
          </p>

          <h3>Prototype</h3>
          <p>In the process of testing my concept, I used 2 FSR sensors, one of which I made, and Processing to create the visualization. The idea behind the visualization is that each circle, representing a sensor, changes color based on how much pressure is being applied to the sensor. The most difficult part of the prototype was passing data between arduino and processing. I ended up having to convert the values between integers and strings a couple of times.
