            <b>Research Question</b>: How can a bike seat be more comfortable?
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Proposal</b>: My proposal for the final project is to create a bike seat that is more comfortable. Comfort here means two things: reducing pain from long periods of riding on the seat, and preventing rubbing. The comfort of the bike seat is influenced by material, form, padding, how well the seat is adjusted to the biker, as well as other factors. Initial ideas for how to achieve a better seat are as follows.
            <br>

            <ul>
              <li> Creating a bike seat that can be adjusted automatically (through sensing pressure, a phone-based app, other methods) without the rider having to get off of their bike seat </li>
              <li> Rethinking the form of the seat to prevent rubbing and non-ideal body positioning </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <b>Justification</b>: The design of the bike seat or saddle has remained essentially the same since its invention, with small design tweaks over time. Because of the bike seat design, cyclists are more prone to urethral stricture, UTIs, genital numbness, and saddle sores, all of which can lead to long term health problems.
